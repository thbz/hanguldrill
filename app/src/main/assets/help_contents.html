        <h2 id="#whatis">What is HangulDrill?</h2>
        <p><b>HangulDrill</b> is a small application that helps you to practice
            Hangul and Korean numbers.</p>
        <p>HangulDrill is aimed at intermediate Korean learners. It assumes  that you <b>already
            know Hangul and Korean numbers</b>. But, when trying to read Korean text, e.g. in restaurants
            or bus stops in Korea, you feel that you are not comfortable because you read
            Hangul text and Korean numbers too slowly. In that case, you may use HangulDrill to
            practice reading random Hangul text and Korean numbers. A timer will force you to read
            them in a limited time.</p>

        <p>HangulDrill is <b>configurable</b> in order to match your level of proficiency: you may choose
            how many words and/or numbers appear and how much time you will be given to read
            them.</p>

        <p>HangulDrill is <b>free</b> and displays no advertisement. It does not ask for any special right
            on your device.</p>

        <h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
        <p>When you press the <b>Start</b> button, HangulDrill displays by default several
            Korean words and numbers. You must pronounce the Hangul letters and say the numbers in
            Korean in a limited time. When the time is almost off, a progress bar appears at the
            bottom of the screen. When the time is off, the current words and numbers disappear and
            are replaced by a new set of words and numbers.</p>
        <p>That's all you really need to know. But if you want to modify the way HangulDrill works,
            you may use the following menus and commands which are available either at the top of the
            screen or, depending on your device, by pressing the Menu button.</p>
        <p>1)&nbsp;The <b>Config menu</b>, at the top center of the screen, lets you choose
            a set of predefined settings. For example, one configuration may ask you only digits
            very quickly, another configuration may ask only words on a slow pace. A few built-in configurations are
            defined when you install HangulDrill; see below to learn how to add your own
            configurations if the default configurations do not match your needs.</p>
        <p>2)&nbsp;The <b>Settings menu</b> allows you to control how many words and how many
            digits are displayed, as well as the delay for reviewing each syllable and each digit.
            Delay can be tuned by selecting a "speed" (10 speeds are available).
            Modified settings will be remembered when you leave HangulDrill and come
            back later. When you select a configuration in the Config menu, the current
            settings are forgottent and replaced by the settings associated with the configuration.</p>
        <p>The Settings menu also contains display parameters: text size and theme (i.e text
            color and background color). These parameters are not associated to configurations.</p>
        <p>3)&nbsp;The <b>Action menu</b> contains the following commands.</p>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;<b>Save current settings in a configuration</b>. With this command, the
            current settings (which you can view and edit with the Settings menu) will be saved
            in a new configuration, which you can select later in the Configuration menu. This is
            useful if you want to switch between configurations, e.g. to practice words every
            morning and numbers every afternoon.</p>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;<b>Manage configurations</b>. This command only lets you delete one or more
            configurations. You may delete configurations that you have saved (see above, "save the
            current settings in a new configuration"), or even the built-in configurations provided
            when installing HangulDrill (see above, "The Settings menu"), if you never use them.
            If you want to modify an existing configuration, you only need to select it in the
            Configuration menu, then modify the settings and save them in a new configuration.</p>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;<b>Reinitialize configurations</b>. This command will restore the
            Configuration menu as it was when you installed HangulDrill. Your own configurations
            will be deleted and the built-in configurations will be restored.</p>
        <p>&mdash;&nbsp;<b>Help</b>: displays the Help window (i.e. this text).</p>

        <h2 id="memo">Memo</h2>

        <p>Of course you already know all Korean numerals, including 조 and 여든, but here is a
            short memo, just in case...</p>

        <p><b>Sino-Korean cardinals</b>: 1&nbsp;(일), 2&nbsp;(이), 3&nbsp;(삼), 4&nbsp;(사), 5&nbsp;(오),
            6&nbsp;(육), 7&nbsp;(칠), 8&nbsp;(팔), 9&nbsp;(구), 10&nbsp;(십), 100&nbsp;(백),
            1&nbsp;000&nbsp;(천), 10&nbsp;000&nbsp;(만), 100&nbsp;000 000&nbsp;(억),
            1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;(조).</p>
