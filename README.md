# hanguldrill
A small Android application to practice Hangul and Korean numbers

HangulDrill is aimed at intermediate Korean learners. It assumes  that you **already know Hangul and Korean numbers**.
But, when trying to read Korean text, e.g. in restaurants or bus stops in Korea, you feel that you are not comfortable because you read
Hangul text and Korean numbers too slowly. In that case, you may use HangulDrill to
practice reading random Hangul text and Korean numbers. A timer will force you to read
them in a limited time.

HangulDrill is **configurable** in order to match your level of proficiency: you may choose
how many words and/or numbers appear and how much time you will be given to read
them.

HangulDrill is **free** and displays no advertisement. It does not ask for any special right on your device.
